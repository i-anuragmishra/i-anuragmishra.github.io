                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m Anurag Mishra, a dedicated AI researcher and engineer with a Master’s degree
                    in Artificial Intelligence from RIT. My journey in AI is driven by a deep curiosity
                    to understand and address the complexities of machine learning and its impact on society.
                    With expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision,
                    I’ve worked on groundbreaking projects like bias detection in Retrieval-Augmented
                    Generation (RAG) systems and contributed to research that has been accepted at leading
                    conferences, including NeurIPS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond research, I’ve honed my leadership and organizational skills as the Secretary
                    of the RIT AI Club, where I’ve fostered collaboration, hosted events, and driven
                    discussions around cutting-edge AI topics. My work has also intersected with
                    societal impact, as I’ve collaborated on projects focused on accessibility,
                    such as using AI and GIS to improve emergency services for the deaf and
                    hard-of-hearing community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about building AI systems that are not only innovative but also
                    ethical, fair, and practical. Whether it’s exploring the nuances of bias in AI
                    models or designing robust solutions for complex problems, I thrive on bridging
                    the gap between theoretical research and real-world application. I’m always
                    eager to tackle new challenges, collaborate with diverse teams, and contribute
                    to shaping the future of AI.
