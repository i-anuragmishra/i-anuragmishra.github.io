                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Anurag Mishra, a dedicated AI researcher and engineer with a Master's degree
                    in Artificial Intelligence from RIT. My journey in AI is driven by a deep curiosity
                    to understand and advance the field of machine learning, particularly in explainable AI
                    and ethical AI development. With expertise in natural language processing, deep learning,
                    and computer vision, I've worked on groundbreaking projects in deepfake detection and
                    bias mitigation in large language models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond research, I've honed my leadership and organizational skills as the Secretary
                    of the RIT AI Club, where I've fostered collaboration, hosted events, and driven
                    discussions around cutting-edge AI topics. My work focuses on developing robust
                    AI systems that combine state-of-the-art performance with interpretability and
                    ethical considerations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about building AI systems that are not only innovative but also
                    ethical, fair, and practical. Whether it's exploring the nuances of neural machine
                    translation, developing explainable AI systems, or investigating adversarial robustness
                    in deep learning models, I thrive on bridging the gap between theoretical research and
                    real-world applications. I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and contribute to
                    advancing the field of AI.
